## Brew Buddy

Brew Buddy is a simple tea companion that allows users to manage their tea collection.

It lets you create favorite and owned tea lists while also making it possible to set your preferred infusion time for each one. 

It also makes tea brewing really easy! Just look at your tea list and each tea will have a timer with your preferred infusion time next to it.
